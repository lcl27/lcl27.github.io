        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Italian born, London-raised with a keen interest on all things finance, technology and geopolitics and history, I like to explore multi-faceted and diverse perspectives on new and innovative concepts and practical applications. I have also developed further interests in blockchain, crypto, health / fitness and nutrition - your average Millenial cohort guy.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">I am a passionate and driven individual with a strong work ethic and a desire to succeed. I am also a team player and enjoy collaborating with others to achieve common goals.</p>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">I have been working in corporate finance in London capital markets since 2017, coordinating IPO transactions, general M&A work as well as acting as a retained nominated and corporate adviser to quoted clients. I have advised on over 17 transactions across UK public and private capital markets with an aggregate deal value of Â£125m+.</p>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to this, I worked in market research, executive search and competitor intelligence research for global multinational corporates, financial institutions and legal firms for 1.5 year following completion of my academic studies in politics and international relations and international financial law.</p>
